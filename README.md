#Prefab Evolution.
##Available on **Asset Store** <https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17557>

You've just stumbled onto the best prefab management tool available.
Prefab Evolution offers advanced nested prefab and prefab-inheritance support, perfectly integrated with the Unity editor. Once you use it, you'll never want to work without it again. Seriously. 

Nested prefabs offer the ability to create, modify, and save prefabs within other prefabs, without breaking any existing prefab connections. 

Prefab inheritance goes a step further, letting you create prefabs that share a common ancestry, while maintaining the relationships between each prefab in the "family tree." 

These features enable incredible new workflows, making it easy to build and maintain even the most complex objects and systems inside your project.

##Features:
- Works flawlessly with Unity Free and Unity Pro. 
- Full UnityUI and nGUI support. 
- Inherit from prefabs created by the model importer. 
- Expose any prefab properties for better prefab encapsulation. 
- Full source code included.
